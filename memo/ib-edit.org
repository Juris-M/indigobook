* Overview

Indigo Book (IB) specifies citation forms for use in writing about US
law. The guide must be updated from time to time, both to extend its
scope of coverage, and to reflect periodic changes in the citation
fashion world. The JM Indigo Book style (JM-IB style) for Jurism is a
machine implementation of the IB citation rules, used to generate
context-sensitive citations in user documents and bibliographies. When
the IB guide is updated, the code of the JM-IB style must also be
revised.

While both IB and the JM-IB style ultimately serve the same
audience—authors of legal text—their maintenance draws on different
skill sets: while IB describes the (possibly handwritten)
human-readable form of citations, the JM-IB style is expressed in the
CSL-M style language[fn:1] used to automate that output. Given the
complexity of legal citation conventions, separate maintenance of the
two resources is burdensome, with significant replication of work.

This memo outlines an integrated approach to IB and JM Indigo Book
updates, with a view to streamlining the maintenance of both.

* Document view

In the HTML view of the IB text, citation examples would be decorated
with link markup, shown in the example below.

[[./indigo-book-edit-1.png]]

(Under the hood, citations are each marked up with an identifer in the
format specified in Appendix 2 below.)

* Feedback popup

Clicking on the link opens a popup showing the Jurism fields
from which the citation is generated (this is illustrated in the linked [[https://juris-m.github.io/indigobook/][demo
page]]).

[[./indigo-book-edit-2.png]]

* Editorial workflow

To casual readers, the popup thus just shows a simple quick
reference, listing the Jurism metadata needed to produce a correct
citation. For logged-in users, the popup offers a
self-explanatory mechanism for suggesting changes to the IB guidelines
and the JM-IB style.

Clicking the "Save" button opens the suggestion for review by an
editorial panel, leveraging the version control and discussion
infrastructure of GitHub to manage discussion and disposition. The
workflow is illustrated in the Appendix 1 below.

* Appendix 1: Workflow

[[./workflow.png]]

The moving parts in this diagram may need some explanation.

- Jurism Library Items ::
	 Each of the examples in the Indigo Book text will have a
     corresponding item in a companion library online. This will be a
     standard =zotero.org= shared library (such as [[https://www.zotero.org/groups/2399060/2019-vis-moot/library][this one]]), editable
     through a Jurism client by editors with appropriate permissions,
	 and accessible via the Zotero API.

- Popup ::
		   The popup links written into the IB text will call for item
           metadata over the Zotero API using JavaScript activated by
           clicking the link, and use the returned values to build the
           popup view.

- JM Style Tests ::
					Each item in the Jurism library will have a
                    corresponding test fixture, stored in a GitHub
                    project. The tool for generating and running these
                    fixtures (=cslrun=, provided by the Node package
                    [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/citeproc-test-runner][citeproc-test-runner]]) has been developed.

- "Save" button ::
				   The "Save" button will recompose a test fixture,
                   and file it as a "pull request," a proposed change
                   to the existing fixture, via the GitHub API,
                   accessible to logged-in users.
- Discussion ::
				GitHub pull requests are associated with a tracker,
				where the proposed change can be discussed, possibly
				modified, and either accepted for merge or rejected.
				The tracker is similar to an ordinary discussion forum.
				By leveraging this infrastructure, we avoid the need
				for maintenance of bespoke editorial support tools
				specific to IB and JM-IB.

- Update ::
			From time to time, proposed citation changes that have
            been discussed and merged can be folded into the IB text
            for release as a new edition, together with any edits to
            the IB text itself. The update would be automated by a
            separate tool, run independently of the workflow for
            proposed changes by a citation-maintenance editor.

* Appendix 2: Citation ID format

Citation IDs are set on the =name= attribute of citation spans
in the text, and consist of three to five elements.

{{{noindent}}}[[./cite-id-format.png]]

** Required elements

- 1. Prefix signal ::
     Signals are set from a controlled list. The available signals
     are: *none*, *eg*, *accord*, *see*, *seealso*, *seeeg*, *cf*,
     *contra,* *butsee*, and *seegenerally*.

- 2. Item key ::
     The item key matches the key of an item in the =jsti-indigobook=
     shared library.

- 3. Position ::
     The position marker must be an integer between one and three, where
     *0* is first reference (full form), *1* is /id./, *2* is /id./ with
     a pinpoint locator, and *3* is a subsequent reference.

** Optional elements

- 4. Pinpoint ::
     The optional pinpoint reference is written freehand with "+"-style URI
     encoding, using the [[https://citeproc-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csl-m/index.html#locator-terms][shorthand labels]] recognized by =citeproc-js=.

- 5. Supplementary locator elements ::
     Supplementary elements may be appended to the locator with a vertical
     bar divider. If the first string following the divider parses as
     0000-00-00, it is used as =locator-date= in citation input. All other
     content is set on the =locator-extra= variable.

		   
* Footnotes

[fn:1] CSL-M is short for "Citation Style Language for Juris-M," and
extension of the CSL grammar recognized by Zotero and other fine
reference management tools.
