* Overview

This memo should be read in conjuction with the [[https://juris-m.github.io/indigobook][Indigo Book + Jurism Demo]] page.

Indigo Book (IB) specifies citation forms for use in writing about US
law. The guide must be updated from time to time, both to extend its
scope of coverage, and to reflect periodic changes in bibliographic
fashion. The JM Indigo Book style (JM-IB) for Jurism is a
machine implementation of the IB citation rules, capable of generating
context-sensitive citations in user documents and bibliographies.
When the IB guide is updated, the code of the JM-IB style must also be
revised. When the two are aligned, users save time, which can be put
toward improving arguments and reflecting on ethical obligations.

Development of IB and JM-IB has until now proceeded in parallel, the
former being the domain of lawyers, and the latter the territory of
citation geeks versed in the CSL-M style language.[fn:1] This has led
to discrepancies, holes in coverage, and replication of
effort. Quality on both sides can be improved, and maintenance burdens
lightened, by working together to build a common ecosystem for the
support of legal drafting.

The two projects have arisen as volunteer efforts motivated by
idealism: IB by the conviction that legal citation standards are a
public resource that should be freely available; and JM-IB by a belief
that reference manager support should be brought to bear on legal
writing. Both have achieved their initial aims through the dedication
of highly motivated individuals; but there are costs associated with
maintenance, and the potential benefits of both efforts will depend on
sustainability.

It is a principle that both the Indigo Book and the Jurism reference
manager be open-source, open-access tools. This is critical to their
core objectives, and essential for their broad dissemination. At the
same time, soliciting voluntary contributions in recognition of their
existence is unlikely to generate much enthusiasm among users or
professional bodies: the products are out there, and while their value
would decline over time if not maintained, there is no cliff-edge
to access or functionality to motivate a funding drive.

To encourage continuing contributions from end users, access to an
enhanced copy of Indigo Book, as illustrated in the [[https://juris-m.github.io/indigobook/][demo page]], could
be offered as a value-added service tied to a Patreon pledge, together
with a support forum for members. The integration can be fully
automated. The demo page illustrates login via the [[https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication][GitHub API]] for
submission of errata. In a similar fashion, the popup examples
themselves, currently shown in the clear, could be made to depend on
login via the [[https://docs.patreon.com/#apiv2-oauth][Patreon API]], and maintenance of a pledge there. If done
well, the popup guidance should allow users to quickly set to work on
legal projects in Jurism. Once in the circle, some users will continue
their support over time, gradually expanding the support base for
maintenance of both Indigo Book and Jurism.

The remainder of this memo concerns an editorial workflow built around
an enchanced Indigo Book page, leveraging GitHub and the automated
citation infrastructure embedded in Jurism.

* Document view

In the HTML view of the IB text, citation examples would be decorated
with link markup, shown in the example below.

[[./indigo-book-edit-1.png]]

* Feedback popup

Clicking on the link would expose a popup showing the Jurism fields
from which the citation is generated and, for logged-in users,[fn:2]
a form for proposing a change to the example.

[[./indigo-book-edit-2.png]]

* Editorial workflow

To casual readers, the popup would thus just show a simple quick
reference, listing the Jurism metadata needed to produce a correct
citation. For logged-in users, the popup would also provide a
self-explanatory mechanism for suggesting changes to the IB guidelines
and the JM-IB style.

Clicking the "Save" button would open the suggestion for review by an
editorial panel, leveraging the version control and discussion
infrastructure of GitHub to manage discussion and disposition. The
workflow is illustrated in the Appendix below.

The moving parts in this diagram may need some explanation.

- Jurism Library Items ::
	 Each of the examples in the Indigo Book text will have a
     corresponding item in a companion library online. This will be a
     standard =zotero.org= shared library (such as [[https://www.zotero.org/groups/2399060/2019-vis-moot/library][this one]]), editable
     through a Jurism client by editors with appropriate permissions,
	 and accessible via the Zotero API.

- Popup ::
		   The popup links written into the IB text will call for item
           metadata over the Zotero API using JavaScript activated by
           clicking the link, and use the returned values to build the
           popup view.

- JM Style Tests ::
					Each item in the Jurism library will have a
                    corresponding test fixture, stored in a GitHub
                    project. The tool for generating and running these
                    fixtures (=cslrun=, provided by the Node package
                    [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/citeproc-test-runner][citeproc-test-runner]]) has been developed.

- "Save" button ::
				   The "Save" button will recompose a test fixture,
                   and file it as a "pull request," a proposed change
                   to the existing fixture, via the GitHub API,
                   accessible to logged-in users.
- Discussion ::
				GitHub pull requests are associated with a tracker,
				where the proposed change can be discussed, possibly
				modified, and either accepted for merge or rejected.
				The tracker is similar to an ordinary discussion forum.
				By leveraging this infrastructure, we avoid the need
				for maintenance of bespoke editorial support tools
				specific to IB and JM-IB.

- Update ::
			From time to time, proposed citation changes that have
            been discussed and merged can be folded into the IB text
            for release as a new edition, together with any edits to
            the IB text itself. The update would be automated by a
            separate tool, run independently of the workflow for
            proposed changes by a citation-maintenance editor.
		   
* Footnotes

[fn:2] The login mechanism is not shown in this example. It would be
implemented as a GitHub login, to enable the "saving" of a suggested
change as a GitHub pull request (see below). In terms of the document
UI, a simple solution would be to add a "Login" button to the popup,
immediately below the metadata listing.

[fn:1] CSL-M is short for "Citation Style Language for Juris-M," and
extension of the CSL grammar recognized by Zotero and other fine
reference management tools.
